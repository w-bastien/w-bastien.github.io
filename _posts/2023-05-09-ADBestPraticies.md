## Introduction

In this document i will centralized all best praticices to setup an configure an Active Directory domain.
This list might be not complete but it is a good start.

## DNS Server

* Enable reverse lookup
* Configure DNS redirector to at least 2 public DNS
* Use AD integrated DNS zone

## DNS Client

* DNS configuration for DC should use 127.0.0.1 at the bottom of the DNS server list

## Domain Controler

* Dispatch FSMO roles on different servers
* The database folder and the sysvol folder should be on dedicated disk
* Do not include DC in failover cluster if virtualizied

## Active Directory

* Enable the recycle bin
* Create the KDS root key to enable the use of gMSA
* Have one GC per AD site (Do not set GC on RODC)

## Governance

* Define naming convention for users, devices, groups
* Users, Endpoints and Servers should not be in the same OU
* Keep in mind that your OU should reflect something real in your organization
Aim something like that :

    C[Paris]-->G[Users];
    C[Paris]-->H[Groups];
    B[Bastien-W]-->I[London]-->J[...];
