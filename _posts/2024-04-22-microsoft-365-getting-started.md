In this article I will show you the first things to review when you are starting with a new tenant. I will update this article based on the other topic published on my site. All the information I'm providing should not be viewed as best practices it is based on my experience and my own way of work. \

When I do project I always keep a few thing in mind :

* Remember why you are doing something / What need are you covering ?
* Keep it simple
* Don't try to plan everything
* But still plan a bit
* Governance, Risk, Compliance and Security always needs to be part of the subject  

# General guidance

1. Don't minimize the workload of maintaining Microsoft 365, it evolve quickly and it is very powerful
2. Don't try to replicate how you work on prem to the cloud, this is a mistake I see a lot in Intune and in Entra

* Are you sure that the way you work is the best way to do ? 
* Are the tools compatible with the way you work ?
